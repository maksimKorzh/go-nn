# How to train it?
Just run **python train.py**, it would complete a single cycle
of training. You can then continue training with the existing
model.

# How to use it?
You can play vs the model you've trained yourself or <a href="https://github.com/maksimKorzh/go-nn/releases/tag/0.1">download</a>
pre-trained models from the releases. Adjust path to NN model
in **play-nn.py** or **play-old-vs-new.py** and play vs the
network yourself or watch it playing itself or other models

# Still too complicated?
Watch me running matches between different models during
the training process
